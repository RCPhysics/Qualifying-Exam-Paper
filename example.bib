Here we describe the development of a ratiometric Raman probe for visualizing hydrogen sulfide (H2S) species in living cells as the first alkyne-based sensor for SRS microscopy. This probe uses an azide unit as a selective reactive site{,} and it targets mitochondria with high specificity.

	Abstract = {The clinical routine use of bone allograft transplants dates back to the discovery that grafts devitalized by freezing bear a reduced antigenicity. Graft failures, caused by a host versus graft reaction, however, remain a clinical problem. Previous investigations on pancreatic islet allografts revealed improved survival and biological function when fast cryopreservation (−70$\,^{\circ}$C/min) was performed in the presence of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The aim of this study was to determine the effect of fast freezing using DMSO on the biological function of osteochondral tissues. Organ culture was performed with neonatal femora of mice, untreated, rapidly frozen (−70$\,^{\circ}$C/min) with DMSO, or frozen without DMSO. After the culture, tissue morphology, cellular proliferation, osteoblast function, osteoclasts, and the presence of antigen-presenting cells were investigated. In untreated control femora histology appeared normal and proliferating and collagen-synthesizing osteoblasts, osteoclasts, and B-cells and macrophages were present. In frozen femora (with and without DMSO) a disintegration of the periosteum and the epiphyseal growth plate were observed and no active osteoblasts could be detected. Osteoclasts were partially detached from the bone surface. Cell proliferation was fully blocked in femora frozen in the absence of DMSO, while freezing in the presence of DMSO preserved cell proliferation in the medullary canal. The proliferating cells do not express epitopes present on the cells of the B-cell or macrophage lineages. Although the biological function of osteoblasts and osteoclasts was lost upon freezing of osteochondral tissue, DMSO included in freezing protocols preserves some residual cell viability which may be of importance for early graft revascularization as has been previously demonstrated by our group.},

	Abstract = {Low water permeability is critical to the pressurized blood conduit function of the artery. Arterial wall permeability is altered in diseases including diabetes and atherosclerosis, in acute shock, and with the aging process. Here we directly map the water permeability and the associated pressure profile across intact pressurized arteries with coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering microscopy and D2O tracer experiments. We identify the endothelial basolateral membrane as the major barrier to water permeation. The advantageously positioned water barrier permits the direct transfer of arterial pressure to subendothelial elastic macromolecules. The mechanically sensitive endothelial cell is thus protected from static or pulsed-pressure{\textendash}induced deformation. Disruption of this pressure transmission could contribute to endothelial dysfunction in various disease states.The artery wall is equipped with a water permeation barrier that allows blood to flow at high pressure without significant water leak. The precise location of this barrier is unknown despite its importance in vascular function and its contribution to many vascular complications when it is compromised. Herein we map the water permeability in intact arteries, using coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) microscopy and isotopic perfusion experiments. Generation of the CARS signal is optimized for water imaging with broadband excitation. We identify the water permeation barrier as the endothelial basolateral membrane and show that the apical membrane is highly permeable. This is confirmed by the distribution of the AQP1 water channel within endothelial membranes. These results indicate that arterial pressure equilibrates within the endothelium and is transmitted to the supporting basement membrane and internal elastic lamina macromolecules with minimal deformation of the sensitive endothelial cell. Disruption of this pressure transmission could contribute to endothelial cell dysfunction in various pathologies.},

	Abstract = {Cumulus cell-enclosed bovine oocytes in germinal vesicle (GV) and in metaphase II (MII) stages were cryopreserved. Different concentrations (1 M; 1.5 M) of various cryoprotectants (glycerol, PROH, DMSO) were tested. After thawing, the oocytes were exposed to various carbohydrates (sucrose, lactose, trehalose) at a concentration of 0.1 M and 0.25 M for cryoprotectant removal. Developmental capacity of the frozen-thawed oocytes was studied by in vitro maturation, fertilization and culture. We found no difference in subsequent development using glycerol or PROH for GV and MII oocytes. The DMSO treatment led to significantly better cleavage and development up to 4-cell stage in MII oocytes. Development beyond the 8-cell stage was obtained only when unmatured oocytes were frozen. No difference in the efficiency of the 3 cryoprotectants was detected in MII oocytes. However, in GV oocytes, glycerol and PROH yielded significantly better cleavage and 4-cell rate compared to DMSO (P<0.001). Influence of the concentration of a cryoprotectant on development was not observed in GV or MII oocytes. Among the 3 cryoprotectants, DMSO was less suitable, at both concentrations, than PROH and glycerol for the development of 6- to 8-cell stage embryos in the GV group. In the MII group, 1.5 M DMSO was as efficient as PROH and as glycerol at a 1.5-M concentration, and it was more efficient than 1 M glycerol. The use of carbohydrates during rehydration did not render a beneficial effect at either of the 2 concentrations, and when no carbohydrates were used in the MII group the oocytes cleaved better than GV oocytes.},

@article{Potma:2001aa,
	Abstract = {A nonlinear optical Kerr effect (OKE) microscope was developed and used to elucidate the ultra-fast diffusive motions of intracellular water molecules. In the OKE microscope, a pump-induced birefringence is sensed by a delayed probe pulse within a spatially confined volume that measures 0.5μm in the lateral direction and 4.0μm along the axial coordinate. This microscope allows the recording of time-resolved Kerr signals, which reflect the ultra-fast structural relaxation of the liquid, exclusively from intracellular aqueous domains. Because relaxation occurs on a picosecond time scale, only local diffusive motions are probed. The microscopic OKE signal is therefore insensitive to long-time-scale hindered translational motions enforced by intracellular mechanical barriers but probes the intrinsic orientational mobility of water molecules in cells instead. The Kerr response as determined from single intact mammalian cells under physiological conditions shows a structural relaxation time of 1.35ps, which is 1.7 times slower than the Kerr decay observed in pure water. The data indicate that the mobility of water molecules in cellular domains is moderately restricted due to the high intracellular content of proteins and solutes.},

	Abstract = {A novel type of non-linear Raman microscopy, femtosecond stimulated Raman microscopy (FSRM), is introduced. It employs femtosecond white light pulses and intense picosecond pulses which are derived from a femtosecond laser/amplifier system. The pulses are coupled into a microscope set-up and induce a stimulated Raman process at the focus. The Raman interaction spectrally modulates the white light. These modulations are read-out in multi-channel fashion and allow recording of a complete Raman spectrum of the focal region. By raster-scanning the sample, complete Raman images can be obtained. Raman images of polystyrene beads in water demonstrate the feasibility of the approach. },

We found that laser-scanning TSFG provides vibrationally sensitive imaging capabilities of lipid droplets and structures in sectioned tissue samples. Although the contrast is based on the infrared-activity of molecular modes, TSFG images exhibit a high lateral resolution of 0.5 \&\#x000B5;m or better. We observed that the imaging properties of TSFG resemble the imaging properties of coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) microscopy, offering a nonlinear infrared alternative to coherent Raman methods. TSFG microscopy holds promise as a high-resolution imaging technique in the fingerprint region where coherent Raman techniques often provide insufficient sensitivity.},

	Abstract = {In this study we introduce in situ Raman spectroscopy as an effective tool to distinguish between reversible and irreversible thiol modifications in l-cysteine{,} the most critical host for sulphydryls in proteins and enzymes. We place special emphasis on the conditions under which the formation and breakage of disulphide bonds is reversible and produces free thiol groups. Thiol groups from l-cysteine are highly reactive and are frequently converted into disulphide bonds via reaction with mercaptans{,} including S-methyl methanethiosulfonate (MMTS). It was previously claimed that disulphide groups can be reversibly introduced in and eliminated from l-cysteine in order to restore a free thiol group{,} using a reductant such as tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP). Raman spectroscopy is found to effectively monitor the formation and subsequent breaking of disulphide bonds{,} and demonstrates that although TCEP is effective in breaking disulphide bonds{,} an excess of TCEP is required to reversibly form free thiol groups from l-cysteine. These results will be critical for cysteine--metal bonding investigations. Our Raman mode assignment in MMTS and TCEP also provides a benchmark for future studies using these compounds.},

	Abstract = {Label-free chemical contrast is highly desirable in biomedical imaging. Spontaneous Raman microscopy provides specific vibrational signatures of chemical bonds, but is often hindered by low sensitivity. Here we report a three-dimensional multiphoton vibrational imaging technique based on stimulated Raman scattering (SRS). The sensitivity of SRS imaging is significantly greater than that of spontaneous Raman microscopy, which is achieved by implementing high-frequency (megahertz) phase-sensitive detection. SRS microscopy has a major advantage over previous coherent Raman techniques in that it offers background-free and readily interpretable chemical contrast. We show a variety of biomedical applications, such as differentiating distributions of omega-3 fatty acids and saturated lipids in living cells, imaging of brain and skin tissues based on intrinsic lipid contrast, and monitoring drug delivery through the epidermis.},

	Abstract = {In this paper we have investigated via x-ray diffraction the influence of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), known for its biological and therapeutic properties, on the structure of lipid membranes of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) in excess of the solvent (DMSO/water) at mole DMSO fractions XDMSO ∈ (0.1) and under equilibrium conditions. At small XDMSO≤0.133 the repeat distance d is reduced remarkably, whereas wide-angle x-ray diffraction pattern remains almost unchanged with the increase in XDMSO. It agrees well with previous study (Yu and Quinn, 1995). At 0.133<XDMSO<0.3 the repeat period d reduces slowly; however, an orthorombic in-plane lattice of hydrocarbon chains transfers to a disordered quasihexagonal lattice. The increase in XDMSO from 0.3 up to ∼0.9 leaves d almost unchanged, whereas it leads to less disordered packing of hydrocarbon chains. At XDMSO≈0.9, Lβ′ phase transfers into interdigitated phase. The chain-melting phase transition temperature of DPPC membranes increases by several degrees with the increase of DMSO concentration. It points to a strong concentration-dependent solvation of membrane surface by DMSO. Thus DMSO strongly interacts with the membrane surface, probably displacing water and modifying the structure of the lipid bilayer. It appears to determine some of the properties of DMSO as a biologically and therapeutically active substance.},

@article{ANCHORDOGUY1987324,
	Abstract = {The abilities of a variety of compounds to inhibit liposome fusion during freeze/thaw were assessed by resonance energy transfer. Small unilamellar vesicles have been frozen according to three different protocols. Membrane intermixing was seen to be relatively independent of freezing protocol except when glycerol, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), or sarcosine was used as the cryoprotectant. Low concentrations of polyvinylpyrolidone or 4-hydroxyproline enhanced fusion of liposomes, whereas high concentrations of these compounds had no effect. Glycerol, DMSO, proline, betaine, and sarcosine reduced fusion, but only when their concentrations were greater than 1 M. The most effective cryoprotectants were trehalose and sucrose, which both reduced fusion to minimal levels at concentrations of only 0.2 M. We have also used europium to probe the modes of interaction of these compounds with phospholipids. Europium, which is known to bind to the phosphate headgroup, maximized fusion in liposomes subjected to freeze/thaw. This ``europium-induced'' fusion was progressively reduced by the presence of increasing sucrose, trehalose, or glycerol, suggesting a competition for the headgroup. However, the presence of proline, betaine, or sarcosine did not reduce europium-induced fusion, suggesting that these compounds do not compete for the headgroup. Substitution of polar side chains on the hydrophobic regions of proline or sarcosine eliminate their cryoprotective properties, suggesting that these compounds interact with the acyl chains of the bilayer.},

	Abstract = {Abstract The structure and dynamics of hydrogen-bonded structures are of significant importance in understanding many binary mixtures. Since self-diffusion is very sensitive to changes in the molecular weight and shape of the diffusing species, hydrogen-bonded associated structures in dimethylsulfoxide--methanol (DMSO--MeOH) and DMSO--ethanol (DMSO--EtOH) mixtures are investigated using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) diffusion experiments and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations over the entire composition range at 298 K. The self-diffusion coefficients of DMSO--MeOH and DMSO--EtOH mixtures decrease by up to 15\% and 10\%, respectively, with DMSO concentration, indicating weaker association as compared to DMSO--water mixtures. The calculated heat of mixing and radial distribution functions reveal that the intermolecular structures of DMSO--MeOH and DMSO--EtOH mixtures do not change on mixing. DMSO--alcohol hydrogen-bonded dimers are the dominant species in mixtures. Direct comparison of the simulated and experimental data afford greater insights into the structural properties of binary mixtures.},

Here we introduce a platform that combines deuterium oxide (D2O) probing with stimulated Raman scattering (DO-SRS) microscopy to image in situ metabolic activities. Enzymatic incorporation of D2O-derived deuterium into macromolecules generates carbon--deuterium (C--D) bonds, which track biosynthesis in tissues and can be imaged by SRS in situ. Within the broad vibrational spectra of C--D bonds, we discover lipid-, protein-, and DNA-specific Raman shifts and develop spectral unmixing methods to obtain C--D signals with macromolecular selectivity. DO-SRS microscopy enables us to probe de novo lipogenesis in animals, image protein biosynthesis without tissue bias, and simultaneously visualize lipid and protein metabolism and reveal their different dynamics. DO-SRS microscopy, being noninvasive, universally applicable, and cost-effective, can be adapted to a broad range of biological systems to study development, tissue homeostasis, aging, and tumor heterogeneity.},

Unprotected freezing is normally lethal and this chapter seeks to analyze some of the mechanisms involved and to show how cooling can be used to produce stable conditions that preserve life. The biological effects of cooling are dominated by the freezing of water, which results in the concentration of the solutes that are dissolved in the remaining liquid phase. Rival theories of freezing injury have envisaged either that ice crystals pierce or tease apart the cells, destroying them by direct mechanical action, or that damage is from secondary effects via changes in the composition of the liquid phase. Cryoprotectants, simply by increasing the total concentration of all solutes in the system, reduce the amount of ice formed at any given temperature; but to be biologically acceptable they must be able to penetrate into the cells and have low toxicity. Many compounds have such properties, including glycerol, dimethyl sulfoxide, ethanediol, and propanediol.},

	Abstract = {Unlike optical microscopies that are based on fluorescence detection, Raman-based micro-spectroscopies provide vibrational signatures that themselves represent quantitative measures of the sample's molecular composition and structures, which for example can be successfully exploited as an intrinsic vibrational contrast of endogenous biomolecular species for label-free tumour diagnostic imaging [1]. In particular, by exploiting the coherent driving and detection of Raman modes in coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) and stimulated Raman scattering (SRS), coherent Raman scattering (CRS) microscopy allows the point-by-point chemical mapping of molecular compounds, which is often difficult to attain by conventional fluorescence and incoherent vibrational microscopy techniques. Here, we will review on two CRS modalities that provide quantitative molecular information [2]: (i) high-speed stimulated Raman loss (SRL) imaging at video-rates and (ii) hyperspectral CARS imaging that provides access to the full wealth of chemical and physical structure information of an a priori unknown molecular sample. We will discuss their underlying principles, their state-of-the-art experimental realizations, and demonstrate exemplifying applications for the label-free and noninvasive 3D visualization of chemical composition as well as of molecular structure properties of (bio)molecular components in heterogeneous and complex materials, ranging from polymers to living cells. Particular emphasis will be given to the combination of coherent Raman scattering spectroscopy with optical microscopy, which has emerged as a highly sensitive and chemically selective tool for the extraction of quantitative molecular structure information from purely imaginary hyperspectral data cubes of the sample's complex third-order nonlinear susceptibility, χ(3)(ν,x,y,z), as obtained by fast hyperspectral CARS imaging in conjunction with spectral phase retrieval algorithms. We will introduce a novel concept based on the wavelet prism decomposition and the maximum entropy method (MEM) for the fast and robust reconstruction of the pure vibrational response of the molecular sample inside a sub-femtoliter probe volume in the presence of experimental artefacts, which may obstruct the accurate phase retrieval from the experimental normalized CARS pixel spectra [3]. Furthermore, we will present exemplifying applications (see Fig. 1) for the quantitative 3D mapping of chemical composition in living cells, the intracellular chemical structure analysis of biologically relevant lipids, and the physical 3D structure analysis in polymers.},

Incorporating biological imaging into the early stages of the drug discovery process can provide invaluable information about drug activity within complex disease models. Spontaneous Raman spectroscopy has been widely used as a platform for the study of cells and their components based on chemical composition; but slow acquisition rates{,} poor resolution and a lack of sensitivity have hampered further development. A new generation of stimulated Raman techniques is emerging which allows the imaging of cells{,} tissues and organisms at faster acquisition speeds{,} and with greater resolution and sensitivity than previously possible. This review focuses on the development of stimulated Raman scattering (SRS){,} and covers the use of bioorthogonal tags to enhance sample detection{,} and recent applications of both spontaneous Raman and SRS as novel imaging platforms to facilitate the drug discovery process.},

@article{ANCHORDOGUY1992117,
	Abstract = {Dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) is known to protect isolated enzymes during freezing while destabilizing proteins at high temperatures. This apparent paradox is the subject of a review by Arakawa et al. ((1990) Cryobiology 27, 401--415), who present evidence for a temperature-dependent, hydrophobic interaction between DMSO and non-polar moieties of proteins. The present study investigates the interaction of DMSO with phospholipid bilayers. Phospholipid vesicles containing car☐yfluorescein were exposed to several concentrations of DMSO at various temperature. Leakage rates increased with DMSO concentration and temperature. This effect was not reduced in the presence of solutes that have been shown to neutralize DMSO toxicity in tissues. The increased leakage rates correlate well with the increased partitioning of DMSO from water to octanol at higher temperatures. Additionally, reductions in the CH2 vibrations of the bilayer are also shown to depend on DMSO concentration and temperature. A similar reduction in CH2 vibrations was observed in solutions of octanol and DMSO, suggesting that this effect is not mediated through an interaction with water. Furthermore, investigation of sulfoxide vibrations indicate that DMSO is not hydrogen bonded to the alcohol moiety of octanol, and therefore the interaction between DMSO and octanol is most likely due to a hydrophobic association. These results are consistent with a destabilization of phospholipid membranes at higher temperatures due to a hydrophobic association between DMSO and the bilayer.},

It is concluded that techniques that avoid the formation of ice altogether are most likely to yield effective methods for the cryopreservation of recalcitrant tissues and vascularised organs.},

The excitation of fluorophores having single-photon absorption in the ultraviolet with a stream of strongly focused subpicosecond pulses of red laser light has made possible fluorescence images of living cells and other microscopic objects. The fluorescence emission increased quadratically with the excitation intensity so that fluorescence and photo-bleaching were confined to the vicinity of the focal plane as expected for cooperative two-photon excitation. This technique also provides unprecedented capabilities for three-dimensional, spatially resolved photochemistry, particularly photolytic release of caged effector molecules.},

	Abstract = {Label-free nonlinear optical microscopy (NLOM) based on two-photon excited fluorescence (TPEF) from cofactors nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD+) is widely used for high-resolution cellular redox imaging. In this work, we combined three label-free NLOM imaging methods to quantitatively characterize breast cancer cells and their relative invasive potential: (i) TPEF optical redox ratio (ORR = FAD+/NADH + FAD+), (ii) coherent Raman scattering of cellular lipids, and (iii) second harmonic generation of extracellular matrix (ECM) collagen. 3D spheroid models of primary mammary epithelial (PME) cells and breast cancer cell lines (T47D and MDA-MB-231) were characterized based on their unique ORR and lipid volume fraction signatures. Treatment with 17β-estradiol (E2) increased glycolysis in both PME and T47D ER+ breast cancer acini. However, PME cells displayed increased lipid content with no effect on ECM, while T47D cells had decreased lipid storage (P \&lt; 0.001) and significant reorganization of collagen. By measuring deuterated lipids synthesized from exogenously administered deuterium-labeled glucose, treatment of T47D cells with E2 increased both lipid synthesis and consumption rates. These results confirm that glucose is a significant source for the cellular synthesis of lipid in glycolytic breast cancer cells, and that the combination of cellular redox and lipid fraction imaging endpoints is a powerful approach with new and complementary information content.Significance: These findings provide unique insight into metabolic processes, revealing correlations between cancer metastasis and cellular redox state, lipid metabolism, and extracellular matrix.
